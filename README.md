# Repository of My Final Year Project  
The name of the project is Visual Perception of Self-Driving cars. Autonomous cars are the future smart cars anticipated to be driver less, efficient and crash avoiding ideal urban car of the future. To reach this goal automakers have started working in this area to realize the potential and solve the challenges currently in this area to reach the expected outcome. In this regard the first challenge would be to customize and imbibe existing technology in conventional vehicle to translate them to a near expected autonomous car. This transition of conventional vehicles into an autonomous vehicle by adopting and implementing different upcoming technologies is discussed in this project. This includes the objectives of autonomous vehicles and their implementation difficulties. The project also touches the introduction of autonomous vehicles in Indian market in comparison to other markets and aspects of the future market.


## Visual Perception for Self Driving Cars

Here We Developed Three Models:  
1) Lane line Detection Using OpenCV     
2) Traffic Sign Detection & Recognition    
3) Beheavioural Clonning and AV Model with Simulator(eg. Here we used Udacity Simulator for Testing Purposes).
